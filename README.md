# Bank Direct Marketing Classification
### USING MACHINE LEARNING FOR BANK DIRECT MARKETING: AN APPLICATION OF THE CRISP-DM METHODOLOGY

### Overview
In this third practical application assignment, we compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines). The dataset is from UCI with the marketing of bank products over the telephone in Portugal.

### Data
The dataset used comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository.
The data is from a Portuguese banking institution and is a collection of the results of
multiple marketing campaigns.

### Deliverables:
After understanding, preparing and modeling the data, I built two Jupyter Notebooks that include a clear statement demonstrating my knowledge of the business problem, a correct and concise interpretation of descriptive and inferential statistics, my findings, and next steps and recommendations.
I compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines).

#### I have attached the following three files.

2) Practical Application III-TB-1-FeatureEngr-Modelling-Classification-Final.ipynb
3) A pdf document with a summry of the classification models
